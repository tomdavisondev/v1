Auto Macro is a C# utility that allows users to automate tasks on their computer by creating complex sequences of input. It uses WPF to create its GUI and makes use of the .NET framework and Windows hooks to monitor and intercept input events in the operating system. This allows Auto Macro to respond to user input and record/execute defined sequences of input, saving time and effort when performing repetitive tasks.
